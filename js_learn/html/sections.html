    <h3>Section1</h3>
    <p>In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy
        (呪力, Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout
        the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result,
        they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi),
        a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These
        Curses are shown as gruesome monsters: onryō (vengeful spirit), yūrei (ghosts), and yōkai.
        Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, Jujutsushi, lit. "Cursed Technique Masters" or "Shamans") are 
        people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as 
        they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine 
        this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, Jujutsushiki), which tend to be
        unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion
        (領域展開, Ryōiki Tenkai), which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size. Inside
        the Domain, all of their attacks are guaranteed to hit and will grow in strength.

    <h3>Section2</h3>
        <p>In Taishō era Japan, a secret organization known as the "Demon Slayer Corps" 
        has waged a war against demons for centuries. Demons are former humans who possess supernatural
        abilities such as enhanced strength, rapid regeneration, and unique powers referred to as 
        "Blood Demon Arts". Demons can only be killed if they are exposed to direct sunlight, decapitated 
        with weapons crafted from an alloy called Nichirin, or injected with a poison extracted from wisteria flowers.
        In contrast, the Demon Slayers are entirely human but employ specialized elemental breathing techniques 
        known as "Breathing Styles". These techniques grant them superhuman strength, heightened abilities, and 
        increased resilience that enable them to fight demons effectively. The most formidable Demon Slayers are 
        known as the "Ha
        shira" and gain this title through multiple advancements in the Corps' ranks, culminating 
        in killing fifty demons at the highest level or a member of the Twelve Kizuki.
